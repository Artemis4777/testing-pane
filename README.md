Prerequisites: (Skip if you already have all these)
  1. Python 3 or higher (download from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. VS Code (download from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  3. Virtualenv module for Python (install while in VS Code by opening a terminal > type "pip install virtualenv" > enter)
  
Setting up environment, and running:
  1. Download this repo and unzip the file.
  2. In VS Code - click on "File" in the top left.
  3. Select "Open Folder".
  4. Find the folder that you created when you unzipped the downloaded repo, and select it.
  5. In the terminal - type "virtualenv venv", hit "Enter", and wait for a few moments.
  6. Click "Yes" on the notification that pops up on the bottom right of the window.
  7. Open a new terminal. You should see that you are now in a virtual environment (it will show "(venv)" at the start of the line in the terminal).
  8. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt", and hit "Enter".
  9. Once everything gets installed (it will go back to showing "(venv)" in the terminal), you can run it by going to the "application.py" file and clicking on the Play button in the top right of the window.
  10. Visit one of the links you see in the terminal (if it worked).
